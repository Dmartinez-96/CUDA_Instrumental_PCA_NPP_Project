These example files demonstrate what the results should look like for processing the files in data/WAV_files. 

Additionally, the .png files produced by the Jupyter Notebook in src/vis/VisualizeResults.ipynb for the example data are here as well.

Try implementing the code for data/Extra_WAV_files, too by implementing some sort of average for common instruments!
